# US-Bikeshare-Stats
In this project Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Data was imported from .CSV files to answer given questions using descriptive statistics. A script was written that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal and present these statistics.


# Background on the source data

.CSV files are sourced from Motivate, a US bike share system provider.

The dataset is randomized information from January through June 2017 for New York City, Washington, and Chicago.

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. Subscriber or Customer User
7. Gender (New York City and Chicago)
8. Birth Year (New York City and Chicago)


# Statistics Computed:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

    total travel time
    average travel time

#4 User info

    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
